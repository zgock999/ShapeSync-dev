# Chapter 4: Outfit Registration and Attach/Detach Operation Check

[← Back to Tutorial Index](./index.html) ｜ [← Chapter 3: Figure Registration and Initial Operation Check](./figureregistration.html)

This chapter explains the steps to create **Hairstyle (Hair1)** and **Outfit (Dress1)** to be worn by the character, register them as Outfits in ShapeSync Editor, and verify attach/detach operations on the Figure as well as body shape deformation tracking.

* **First Half (VRoid Studio)**: Create and export VRM files with hairstyles and outfits equipped from presets.
* **Second Half (Unity / ShapeSync)**: Register exported VRMs into ShapeSync Editor's Database to generate assets, and attach them to the Figure using OutfitAttacher.

> [!NOTE]
> This chapter assumes that the Base VRM (BasicFemale.vrm), FBM axis (SampleI.vrm), and generated Figure Prefab created in the previous chapter ([Chapter 3: Figure Registration and Initial Operation Check](./figureregistration.html)) are prepared.

---

## 1. Introduction (Core Concepts of Outfits and VRMs to Prepare)

* **Outfit**: Decorative assets such as clothing and hairstyles worn by the character. In ShapeSync, these are managed as **Mesh Outfits** accompanied by meshes.
* **Mesh Outfit Materials (Material Classification)**: When registering an Outfit, the materials included in the model are classified into "parts to retain as the Outfit (**Include**)" and "body parts on the wearer side not included in the Outfit (**Exclude**)". By designating body parts as Exclude, only the mesh of the outfit or hairstyle is correctly extracted.
* **OutfitAttacher**: A Unity component attached to the generated Figure that allows attaching, detaching, and synchronizing arbitrary Outfit Prefabs during Play Mode.

### 4 VRMs to Prepare in This Chapter
Because Outfits are required for both the Base body shape and the FBM body shape, create the following 4 files:

1. **Hair1BasicFemale.vrm**: Model with hairstyle equipped on BasicFemale (Base)
2. **Hair1SampleI.vrm**: Model with hairstyle equipped on SampleI (FBM)
3. **Dress1BasicFemale.vrm**: Model with outfit equipped on BasicFemale (Base)
4. **Dress1SampleI.vrm**: Model with outfit equipped on SampleI (FBM)

## 2. Registering Custom Hair and Exporting Equipped VRMs (VRoid Studio)

First, use VRoid Studio to save hairstyles from the preset model as custom items, equip them on Base and FBM models, and export them.

### 2.1 Saving Hairstyles as Custom Items from AvatarSample_I

2. Select the **Hairstyles** tab in the top menu.
3. Select **Front** from the left menu, switch to the **Custom** tab, and select **Save as Custom Item** for the equipped front hair.

## 6. Scene Placement and Attach/Detach and Operation Check with OutfitAttacher

Attach the generated Outfit Prefabs to the Figure in the Scene, and verify real-time attaching/detaching and body shape deformation tracking.

### Attach/Detach and Operation Check Steps
1. Place the **Figure Prefab** generated in Chapter 3 in the Scene (or Hierarchy).
2. Confirm the **OutfitAttacher** component attached to the root GameObject of the Figure.
   * Outside Play Mode, `Enter Play Mode to attach an Outfit Prefab.` is displayed, and attach operations cannot be performed.
3. Press Unity's **Play button** to enter **Play Mode**.
4. In the Figure's Inspector, open the **Outfit Prefab Attach** section of OutfitAttacher.
5. Drag and drop Outfits/Hair1.prefab from the Project window into the **Drop Outfit Prefab Here** area.
   * The hairstyle is immediately attached to the Figure, and Hair1 is added to the **Attached Outfits** list.
6. Similarly, drag and drop Outfits/Dress1.prefab from the Project window into the **Drop Outfit Prefab Here** area.
   * The dress is attached to the Figure, and Dress1 is added to the Attached Outfits list.
7. Confirm that clicking the **Delete** button on each row in the Attached Outfits list removes the corresponding Outfit.

*▲Figure 4-22: Inspector and Game view with Hair1 / Dress1 attached to OutfitAttacher in Play Mode*

### Verifying Body Shape Deformation and Animation Tracking
1. Assign Walking.controller to the **Animator** in Figure's Inspector and play the walking animation.
2. While walking is playing, move the **weight** slider for SampleI in the **DynamicBoneBlender** component.
3. Confirm that **during walking animation, the attached hairstyle (Hair1) and outfit (Dress1) smoothly and perfectly follow the body shape deformation of the Figure without breaking**.

## 7. Common Issues and Solutions (Troubleshooting)

### Q1. Nothing happens when dropping onto Drop Outfit Prefab Here in OutfitAttacher
* **Cause**:
  You may not be in Play Mode, or you may be dropping the original .vrm file directly instead of the generated Prefab with ShapeSyncOutfit (Outfits/Hair1.prefab, etc.).
* **Solution**:
  Enter Play Mode (playback active in Unity), and drop the .prefab output to the Outfits/ folder by running Generation.

### Q2. Character body pokes through outfit or renders doubly when outfit is attached
* **Cause**:
  In Materials (Mesh Outfit Materials) during Outfit registration, wearer body materials may not have been set to Exclude.
* **Solution**:
  Open Outfits > [Target Outfit] > Materials in ShapeSync Editor, confirm all body materials other than the outfit are set to Exclude, press Save to Database, and execute Generate again from Generation.

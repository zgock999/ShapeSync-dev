# Chapter 10: Document Storage and Outfit Tag / Priority (Outfit Conflict Control and State Storage/Restoration)

[← Back to Tutorial Index](./index.html) ｜ [← Chapter 9: Advanced VRM Integration (Expression and Physics Configuration and Verification)](./vrmintegration.html)

This chapter explains how to configure **Outfit Tags** and **Priority** to control wearing regions and precedence among multiple outfits, as well as the procedure for **Document storage and loading** to save and restore a character's current wearing and deformation state (Shapes and Outfits) entirely as an asset.

* **First Half (VRoid Studio / ShapeSync Editor)**: Prepare and register separate outfit VRMs for the upper-body top (`Tops1`) and lower-body skirt (`Skirt1`), and configure Tags (`upperchest`, `lowerchest`) and Priority.
* **Second Half (Unity / ShapeDirector)**: Verify outfit conflict and exclusive display in Play Mode, save current wearing states as **Document A (`ShapeSyncDocumentA`)** and **Document B (`ShapeSyncDocumentB`)**, and confirm that they can be loaded and restored in one click from an empty Template List state.

## 1. Introduction (Outfit Conflict Control and Role of Document)

### 1.1 Priority and Tag Exclusive Control for Outfits
When having a character wear multiple outfits simultaneously (tops, bottoms, dresses, etc.), it is necessary to control "which body regions conflict" and "which outfit is displayed when a conflict occurs."
* **Tag (Conflict Region)**: An identifier defining "which region conflicts" (e.g., upper body `upperchest`, lower body `lowerchest`). Outfits sharing the same Tag become subjects of conflict.
* **Priority (Precedence)**: A numerical value determining "which outfit takes precedence" when a conflict occurs. **The outfit with the higher numerical value takes precedence**, and outfits with lower values are automatically hidden (excluded).
* **Separation of Logical Registration and Visual Display**: Even if multiple Templates are registered simultaneously in ShapeDirector, visual display on screen is automatically organized through Tag and Priority exclusive evaluation.

### 1.2 Role of Document
* **What is Document**: A data format that records the current outfit, body proportions (Morph / FBM / PBM), materials, and other states of a character collectively into a single file (`.asset`).
* **Saving and Loading**: By saving a Document, you can instantly switch to a desired coordinate or body proportion simply by loading the Document, without needing to swap individual Templates manually.

## 2. VRM Preparation for Tops1 and Skirt1 and Mesh Outfit Registration

### 2.1 VRM Preparation in VRoid Studio
Prepare the upper-body `Tops1` and lower-body `Skirt1` as separate outfits.

* **`Tops1` (4 types in total)**:
  Because it is affected by chest deformation (`BreastSize` PBM), export a total of 4 types including Base / FBM and PBM follow versions:
  1. Equip Tops on `BasicFemale.vroid` and export as `Tops1BasicFemale.vrm` (Figure 10-1, Figure 10-2).
  2. Equip Tops on `SampleI.vroid` and export as `Tops1SampleI.vrm` (Figure 10-3).
  3. Equip Tops on `BreastSizeBasicFemale.vroid` and export as `Tops1BreastSizeBasicFemale.vrm` (Figure 10-4).
  4. Equip Tops on `BreastSizeSampleI.vroid` and export as `Tops1BreastSizeSampleI.vrm` (Figure 10-5).

* **`Skirt1` (2 types in total)**:
  Because it is not affected by chest deformation (`BreastSize`), export a total of 2 types for Base / FBM:
  1. Equip Skirt on `BasicFemale.vroid` and export as `Skirt1BasicFemale.vrm` (Figure 10-6, Figure 10-7).
  2. Equip Skirt on `SampleI.vroid` and export as `Skirt1SampleI.vrm` (Figure 10-8).

## 4. Verifying Priority / Tag Exclusive Control in Play Mode

### 4.1 Exclusive Display with 3 Templates Registered Simultaneously (Dress1 Display)
1. Select the Figure (`BasicFemale`) placed in the Scene.
2. In the `Template List` of Figure's **`ShapeDirector`** component, register the following Templates:
   * `morphSampleI`
   * `skinSampleI`
   * `hairSampleI`
   * `outfitSkirt1`
   * `outfitTops1`
   * `outfitSampleI` (Dress)
3. Press Unity's **Play button** to enter **Play Mode**.
4. **Checking exclusive display**: Although 3 outfit templates (Tops1, Skirt1, Dress1) are logically registered in the `Template List`, because Priority `20` `Dress1` (`outfitSampleI`) exclusively dominates both `upperchest` and `lowerchest` tags, confirm that **only `Dress1`** is displayed on screen.

![Dress1 exclusive display with 3 Templates registered](./images/23.2-11/10-14.png)
*▲Figure 10-14: Play Mode screen showing only Priority 20 Dress1 exclusively displayed when 3 outfit Templates are registered*

### 4.2 Removing Dress to Display Separate Outfits (Tops1 + Skirt1 Display)
1. During Play Mode, in `Runtime Shapes (Authoritative)` of the `ShapeDirector` Inspector, expand `OutfitShape — outfitSampleI` and click the **`Remove Shape`** button.

![outfitSampleI Remove Shape operation](./images/23.2-11/10-15-1.png)
*▲Figure 10-15-1: Clicking Remove Shape from outfitSampleI in Runtime Shapes*

2. **Checking separate outfit display**: Dress exclusion is lifted, and second-priority **`Tops1` (Priority 10)** and **`Skirt1` (Priority 15)** immediately appear on screen, confirming display as a combined separate outfit (sailor-suit style top + pleated skirt).

## 6. Loading Document after Clearing All Templates (Load A / Load B)

Verify that the outfit state can be restored in one click using saved Documents.

### 6.1 Clearing All Templates from Template List
1. Press Unity's **Play button** to **stop Play Mode** (Because editing the Template List during Play Mode reverts upon stopping, perform deletion in Edit Mode).
2. In Edit Mode, in the **`Template List`** of the `ShapeDirector` Inspector, **delete registered templates one by one to clear all** (empty state).
3. Press Unity's **Play button** again to **start Play Mode**.

### 6.2 Verifying Document A Loading
1. Click the **`Load`** button at the bottom of the `ShapeDirector` Inspector.
2. In the `Load Shape Document` dialog, select **`Assets/ShapeSync/ShapeSyncDocumentA.asset`** and click **`Open`**.

![ShapeSyncDocumentA loading dialog](./images/23.2-11/10-18-1.png)
*▲Figure 10-18-1: Selecting ShapeSyncDocumentA.asset in Load Shape Document dialog*

3. **Verifying restoration**: Runtime Shapes are immediately updated, confirming that the character is restored to the **`Tops1` + `Skirt1`** (separate outfit) state.

![Document A restoration confirmation](./images/23.2-11/10-18-2.png)
*▲Figure 10-18-2: Play Mode screen restored to Tops1 + Skirt1 state upon loading Document A*

### 6.3 Verifying Document B Loading
1. Next, click the **`Load`** button at the bottom of the `ShapeDirector` Inspector.
2. In the `Load Shape Document` dialog, select **`Assets/ShapeSync/ShapeSyncDocumentB.asset`** and click **`Open`**.

![ShapeSyncDocumentB loading dialog](./images/23.2-11/10-19-1.png)
*▲Figure 10-19-1: Selecting ShapeSyncDocumentB.asset in Load Shape Document dialog*

3. **Verifying restoration**: Runtime Shapes immediately switch, confirming that the character is restored to the **`Dress1`** (one-piece dress) state.

## 7. Common Issues and Solutions (Troubleshooting)

### Q1. Only Dress is displayed even though both Tops and Skirt are registered
* **Cause**:
  This is not a defect, but normal exclusive behavior via Tag and Priority. Because `outfitSampleI` (Dress) has Priority `20` and both `upperchest` and `lowerchest` Tags, `outfitTops1` with Priority `10` and `outfitSkirt1` with Priority `15` are automatically excluded (hidden).
* **Solution**:
  If you want to undress the character from the Dress, Remove `outfitSampleI` in the Director.

### Q2. Deleting Template List reverted after stopping Play Mode
* **Cause**:
  Due to Unity specifications, Inspector list modifications made during Play Mode reset to their original state upon stopping Play Mode.
* **Solution**:
  When clearing all templates from the Template List, be sure to stop Play Mode first and delete them after returning to Edit Mode.

### Q3. Appearance does not change after Loading Document
* **Cause**:
  * When saving the Document, the intended wearing state (Runtime Shapes) may not have been active.
  * `ShapeDirector` settings or Mesh Binding asset references may have become disconnected.
* **Solution**:
  Visually confirm that the desired Outfit is correctly displayed during Play Mode before pressing the `Save` button to overwrite-save the Document, then try `Load` again.

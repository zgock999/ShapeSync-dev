# Chapter 6: Advanced Figure Registration and Partial Body Deformation (PBM)

[← Back to Tutorial Index](./index.html) ｜ [← Chapter 5: Shape Registration and Shape Director Operation Check](./shaperegistration.html)

This chapter explains the procedure for registering **Partial Body Morph (PBM)**, which deforms only specific parts of the character (in this tutorial, chest BreastSize), and how to configure outfits (Dress) to follow partial body deformation of the base body.

* **First Half (VRoid Studio)**: Create Base and FBM .vroid data with modified chest sizes, and export 4 PBM VRMs in total for base body (Figure) and outfit-equipped model (Dress).
* **Second Half (Unity / ShapeSync)**: Register PBM (BreastSize) on the Figure side in ShapeSync Editor, configure PBM tracking on the Dress side, override and redefine the Morph Shape (morphSampleI), and verify synchronized operations using ShapeDirector.

## 1. Introduction (Concept of PBM: Partial Body Morph)

* **FBM (Full Body Morph)**: Overall body shape changes of the character (e.g. SampleI) covered in Chapters 2 to 4.
* **PBM (Partial Body Morph)**: Partial body deformations that independently deform specific parts of the character such as chest size, shoulder width, or leg length.
* **ShapeSync Core Feature**: PBM is a basic mesh deformation feature built natively into ShapeSync Core (it is not a VRM facial expression feature or an external extension package feature).

## 2. Creating .vroid Data for BreastSize (VRoid Studio)

First, use VRoid Studio to create .vroid data with modified chest sizes for the Base body and FBM body.

### 2.1 Creating Base PBM Data
1. Launch VRoid Studio and open the base body model **BasicFemale.vroid** created in Chapter 2.
2. Select the **Body** tab in the top menu, and set the **Chest Size** slider in the parameter list to **1.000** (maximum).

## 6. Registering PBM Tracking on Dress

After registering the Figure PBM, configure the outfit (Dress1) to follow that PBM.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always **register the Figure PBM first** before configuring outfit tracking. The outfit side selects tracking relationships based on the PBM axes registered to the Figure.

1. From the left TreeView in ShapeSync Editor, select **Outfits > Mesh Outfits > Dress1 > PBMs**.
2. In the displayed "Mesh Outfit PBMs" list, check **Follow BreastSize** to **enable** it.
3. Once enabled, VRM assignment rows will appear.
   * In the **Base Prefab** row, drag and drop **Dress1BreastSizeBasicFemale.vrm** from the Project window.
   * In the **SampleI Prefab** row, drag and drop **Dress1BreastSizeSampleI.vrm** from the Project window.
4. Click the **Save to Database** button at the very bottom of the screen to save.

## 7. Overriding and Redefining Morph Shape (morphSampleI)

Add deformation weights for the newly added PBM (BreastSize) to the Morph Shape (morphSampleI) created in Chapter 5, and overwrite-save it.

1. From the left TreeView in ShapeSync Editor, select **Shapes > Morph Shapes > morphSampleI** (Do not create a new Shape Id).
2. Check the **Morphs** list on the details screen. SampleI and BreastSize are automatically displayed from the Figure axes.
   * **SampleI** weight: **1** (Maintain existing value)
   * **BreastSize** weight: Set to **0.8** (via slider or numeric input)
   > [!NOTE]
   > In the Shape configuration screen, it is displayed as the logical name **BreastSize** (the physical internal management name after generation becomes PBM_BreastSize).
3. Click the **Save to Database** button at the very bottom of the screen to overwrite-save the existing morphSampleI.

![Adding BreastSize to morphSampleI and overwrite-saving](./images/23.2-7/6-13.png)
*▲Figure 6-13: Maintaining SampleI = 1 and setting BreastSize = 0.8 in Shapes > Morph Shapes > morphSampleI, then overwrite-saving*

## 8. Executing Re-Generate and Updating Shape Templates

Regenerate Shape Template assets from the updated Database.

1. Select the **Generation** section from the left TreeView in ShapeSync Editor.
2. Keep each output relative path at default values, and click the **Generate** button at the bottom of the screen.
3. In the "Generate ShapeSync Figure" dialog, select the output root folder (e.g. Assets/ShapeSync/Generated), click "Select Folder", and execute regeneration.
4. Shape Template assets directly under the output root (morphSampleI.asset, etc.) will be updated.

## 9. Scene Placement and PBM Operation Check with Shape Director

Verify on the Figure in the Scene that PBM (BreastSize) deformation applies synchronously to both Figure and Dress.

1. Select the Figure (BasicFemale) placed in the Scene.
   * Templates are already registered in the Template List of the **ShapeDirector** component from Chapter 5 (No manual re-registration is required).
2. Press Unity's **Play button** to enter **Play Mode**.
   * Because Auto Compile is ON by default, the latest Template is automatically synchronized initially upon entering Play Mode.
3. Expand **Morphs** under **morphSampleI** inside **Runtime Shapes (Authoritative)** of ShapeDirector.
4. Move the **BreastSize** (PBM_BreastSize) slider.
5. Confirm that **while the walking animation continues playing, the chest of the base body (Figure) and the chest of the outfit (Dress) expand and shrink in perfect synchronization, and the outfit does not lag behind or detach**.

![Operating BreastSize slider and verifying synchronized chest deformation in Play Mode](./images/23.2-7/6-15.png)
*▲Figure 6-15: Operating BreastSize during walking animation playback in Play Mode to confirm Figure and Dress chests deform synchronously*

## 10. Common Issues and Solutions (Troubleshooting)

### Q1. Follow BreastSize is not displayed in Dress PBM configuration screen
* **Cause**:
  PBM (BreastSize) may not have been registered and saved on the Figure side.
* **Solution**:
  Open Figure > PBMs first, enter PBM Name: BreastSize, assign VRMs, and press Save to Database. After saving, Follow BreastSize will be displayed when you open Outfits > Mesh Outfits > Dress1 > PBMs.

### Q2. Chest does not deform or Dress does not follow when moving BreastSize in Play Mode
* **Cause**:
  Generate may not have been re-executed after overwrite-saving Morph Shape (morphSampleI), or topology (polygon/bone count) may have changed during VRM export.
* **Solution**:
  Confirm that you re-executed Generate in Generation of ShapeSync Editor. Also verify that polygon count, material count, and bone count of VRMs exported from VRoid Studio match the Base model exactly.

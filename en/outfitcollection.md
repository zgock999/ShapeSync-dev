# Chapter 7: Advanced Outfit Registration and Collection (Shoe Deformation and Alignment)

[← Back to Tutorial Index](./index.html) ｜ [← Chapter 6: Advanced Figure Registration and Partial Body Deformation (PBM)](./pbmregistration.html)

This chapter explains the procedure for using the **Collection** feature, which corrects discrepancies in ankle angles and hip height that occur when a character wears shoes (such as heels or platform shoes).

* **First Half (VRoid Studio)**: Convert shoes from the sample model into custom items, equip them on Base and FBM base bodies, and export 2 shoe VRMs in total.
* **Second Half (Unity / ShapeSync)**: Confirm position discrepancies on the Scene, register Shoes1 in ShapeSync Editor, adjust postures (Hip Y / Foot X rotation) on Collection base body Prefabs and save Overrides, configure **Full Collection (vertex Projection enabled)**, and verify Fit operations.

---

## 1. Introduction (Shoe Position/Posture Discrepancies and Collection Concept)

* **Posture Discrepancy Caused by Shoes**: When wearing shoes with heels or thick soles, ankle angles (Foot tilt) and hip height (Hip Y) change relative to the default standing pose of the base body.
* **Collection Feature**: A feature that automatically tracks and corrects bone postures and mesh vertices when wearing outfits by registering Prefabs with base body postures adjusted to match the shoes.
* **Difference Between Bone and Full**:
  * **Bone**: Corrects only the position and rotation of bones.
  * **Full**: In addition to bone correction, also performs deformation (Projection) of body mesh vertices. This chapter uses **Full** for a reliable fit to the shoes.

## 3. Checking Position and Posture Discrepancies in Scene

Return to the Unity Editor and check the initial relative positions of base body and shoes.

1. Place base body **BasicFemale.vrm** and shoes **Shoes1BasicFemale.vrm** into the Unity Scene.
2. Set Transform Position of both to the identical coordinates **(0, 0, 0)**.
3. Checking the feet in Scene view reveals that the position and posture of base body feet and shoes do not match and are heavily misaligned. Collection is used to correct this discrepancy.

## 4. Registering Outfit (Shoes1) and Classifying Materials

Register the exported shoe VRMs into ShapeSync Editor.

1. From the top menu in Unity Editor, open **Tools > zgock > ShapeSync > ShapeSync Editor**.
2. Select **Outfits** from the left TreeView.
3. Enter **Shoes1** in **Outfit Id** and **Shoes1** in **Outfit Name**, and click the **Create Mesh Outfit** button.
4. Select the created **Outfits > Mesh Outfits > Shoes1**.
5. In **Outfit Prefab**, drag and drop **Shoes1BasicFemale.vrm** from the Project window, and click **Save to Database** at the bottom of the screen.
6. Next, open **Shoes1 > Materials** (Mesh Outfit Materials) from TreeView.
7. Set the **Classification** for body material rows such as face and body to **Projection** instead of Exclude.
8. Keep the shoe material (Shoes_01_CLOTH) as **Include**, set Entry Name to **Shoes1**, and click **Save to Database** at the bottom of the screen.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Classifying body parts as Projection enables the vertex correction (Projection) of Full Collection described later.

## 5. Exporting Collection Base Body Prefabs and Adjusting Posture

Create Collection Prefabs with base body postures adjusted to match the shoes.

### 5.1 Exporting Prefabs
1. Open **Figure** (Base screen) in TreeView, and click the **Export** button in the Prefab on Database row.
2. In the "Export Figure Prefab" dialog, specify destination as **Assets/ShapeSync/Collection/Shoes1/BasicFemale.prefab** and save (maintain default file name).
3. Open the SampleI row in TreeView under **Figure > FBMs**, and click the **Export** button for Prefab on Database.
4. In the "Export FBM Prefab" dialog, specify destination as **Assets/ShapeSync/Collection/Shoes1/SampleI.prefab** and save.
5. Similarly, from **Export** in the Outfit Prefab on Database row of the **Shoes1** Base screen, save **Assets/ShapeSync/Collection/Shoes1/Shoes1BasicFemale.prefab**.
6. From **Export** for Outfit Prefab in the SampleI row of **Shoes1 > FBMs**, save **Assets/ShapeSync/Collection/Shoes1/Shoes1SampleI.prefab**.

![Export completed screen for Collection Prefabs](./images/23.2-8/7-8-1.png)
*▲Figure 7-8-1: State where 4 Prefabs are exported to Assets/ShapeSync/Collection/Shoes1/*

### 5.2 Posture Adjustment in Scene and Saving Overrides
1. Place the created Collection base body **BasicFemale.prefab** and comparison shoe **Shoes1BasicFemale.prefab** into the Scene, setting both to **(0, 0, 0)**.

![Placing Collection base body and comparison shoe Prefab in Scene](./images/23.2-8/7-8-2.png)
*▲Figure 7-8-2: Placing BasicFemale (for Collection) and Shoes1BasicFemale at identical coordinates in Scene*

2. Check the Position Y coordinate (e.g. `0.9225485`) of `Root/J_Bip_C_Hips` on the shoe Prefab (`Shoes1BasicFemale`).

![Checking Hip Y coordinate of shoe Prefab](./images/23.2-8/7-8-3.png)
*▲Figure 7-8-3: Checking Position Y coordinate (0.9225485) of J_Bip_C_Hips on Shoes1BasicFemale*

3. Copy and enter the confirmed value (`0.9225485`) into the Position Y coordinate of `Root/J_Bip_C_Hips` on the Collection base body (`BasicFemale`).

![Copying to Hip Y coordinate of Collection base body](./images/23.2-8/7-8-4.png)
*▲Figure 7-8-4: Entering 0.9225485 into Position Y of J_Bip_C_Hips on BasicFemale*

4. Adjust **Rotation X** of left and right ankle bones (J_Bip_L_Foot and J_Bip_R_Foot) on the Collection base body to fit the shoe tilt snugly (e.g. Rotation X = **3.71**).

![Adjusting Foot Rotation X of Collection base body](./images/23.2-8/7-8-5.png)
*▲Figure 7-8-5: Setting Rotation X of J_Bip_R_Foot on BasicFemale to 3.71 to match shoe tilt*

5. Once adjustments are complete, select the Collection base body (BasicFemale) in Hierarchy, and click **Apply All** from the **Overrides** dropdown in the top right of Inspector to overwrite-save to the Prefab.
   > [!WARNING]
   > If you do not save Overrides (Apply All), adjusted postures will not be reflected in Collection corrections. Do not create a separate dedicated Prefab; always save to this BasicFemale.prefab."

![Executing Apply All from Overrides dropdown](./images/23.2-8/7-8-6.png)
*▲Figure 7-8-6: Clicking Apply All from Overrides dropdown in Inspector to overwrite-save to BasicFemale.prefab*

6. Similarly, place **SampleI.prefab** and **Shoes1SampleI.prefab** in the Scene, copy Hip Y, adjust left and right Foot X rotations, and save Overrides (Apply All) to **SampleI.prefab**.

## 8. Scene Placement and Operation Check with Shape Director, Verifying Poke

Apply shoes to Figure in Scene and check Fit status and remaining issues.

1. Select the Figure (BasicFemale) placed in the Scene.
2. Inspect the **ShapeDirector** component on the Figure.
3. Drag and drop the newly generated **outfitShoes1.asset** into **Template List** (Perform registration before entering Play Mode).
4. Verify that Walking.controller is assigned to Figure's Animator, and press Unity's **Play button** to enter **Play Mode**.
5. While walking animation is playing, confirm that shoe positions and ankle angles fit naturally and track correctly with walking.

![Shoe Fit operation check in Play Mode](./images/23.2-8/7-11-1.png)
*▲Figure 7-11-1: Shoe positions and angles fitting and tracking correctly during walking animation playback in Play Mode*

![Camera angle from under dress](./images/23.2-8/7-11-2.png)
*▲Figure 7-11-2: Tracking state of shoes and feet viewed from beneath dress*

6. Zooming in closely on the feet reveals that base body skin/toes slightly poke out through parts such as the toe area of shoes (**Poke**).

![Close-up check of remaining Poke at toe of shoe](./images/23.2-8/7-11-3.png)
*▲Figure 7-11-3: State of Poke where base body skin slightly protrudes from tip of shoe toe*

> [!NOTE]
> This remaining Poke at the toes is completely resolved using the **Figure Mask** feature explained in the next chapter (Chapter 8).

## 9. Common Issues and Solutions (Troubleshooting)

### Q1. Shoe position or ankle angle is not corrected upon entering Play Mode
* **Cause**:
  After adjusting postures on Collection base body Prefabs (BasicFemale.prefab, etc.), overwrite-saving to the Prefab via **Overrides > Apply All** in the Inspector may not have been performed.
* **Solution**:
  Select the adjusted base body Prefab in the Scene and be sure to click Overrides > Apply All to save. Afterwards, re-execute Generate in Generation of ShapeSync Editor.

### Q2. Body mesh around shoes does not deform cleanly
* **Cause**:
  In Shoes1 > Materials, body part materials may be set to Exclude instead of Projection, or Use Projection for Full Collection may not be enabled in the Collections screen.
* **Solution**:
  Confirm that body materials are set to Projection in Shoes1 > Materials, and that Full and Use Projection for Full Collection is ON in Shoes1 > Collections, save, and re-generate.
